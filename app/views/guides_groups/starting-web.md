# Starting a New Web App

#### Source code
Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Your product repo will be located at `github.com/asm-products/PRODUCTSLUG`. Please push the source code for your app to this repository. Send an email to support@assembly.com if you have problems accessing your repository.

#### Hosting
You are free to use whatever hosting platform you choose, such as Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, Google App Engine, or others.

#### SSL
If you require a SSL certificate for your service, send an email to support@assembly.com.

#### Accepting Payments
You should use Assembly Payments if you would like to charge customers for your product or service. Assembly Payments is a proxy through Stripe that allows your product to collect revenue from customers. Using Assembly payments makes it easy for Assembly to distribute revenue to you and contributors on your product. Assembly will issue US citizens a 1099 if their share of the revenue exceeds a certain threshold as specified by the IRS.

Check out the [Assembly payments repo](https://github.com/asm-products/payments
) and README for instructions on how to integrate Assembly payments with your app. https://github.com/asm-products/payments

#### Domains

Domains for Assembly products are held by core team members in the community. When you choose to contribute to a product, it's important to note who holds the domain and to build trust with that person as you build a product together. If you own a domain for a product, you might put a pledge in the product description that shows your commitment to protecting it on behalf of the community.
