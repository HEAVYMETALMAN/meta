# Starting a New Android app

#### Writing code
You do not need a Google Play subscription to write an Android app.

Assembly makes it easy for you to distribute your app so that you do not have to pay for a developer program subscription with Google. Assembly will publish the app, manage expenses, and distribute revenue to you and your contributors.

#### Source code
Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Your product repo will be located at `github.com/asm-products/PRODUCTSLUG`. Please push the source code for your app to this repository. Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if you have problems accessing your repository.

#### App Distribution
When you are ready to submit your app to the Google Play store for distribution, send an email to assembly@helpful.io with your product name, a link to your source code repositories, and the email address you would like to use to login to the Google Play Developer Console.

#### Monetization and In-App purchases
Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if you are planning to add in-app purchases or use ad SDKs to monetize your app.

#### Domains
Domains for Assembly products are held by core team members in the community(that's you!). When you choose to contribute to a product, it's important to note who holds the domain and to build trust with that person as you build a product together. If you own a domain for a product, you might put a pledge in the product description that shows your commitment to protecting it on behalf of the community.
