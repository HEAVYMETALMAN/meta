# Starting a New iOS App

#### Writing code

You do not need an Apple developer program subscription to write an iOS app.

Assembly makes it easy for you to distribute your app so that you do not have
to pay for a developer program subscription with Apple. Assembly will publish
the app, manage expenses, and distribute revenue to you and your contributors.

#### Source code

Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products
organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Your product repo will be
located at `github.com/asm-products/PRODUCTSLUG`. Please push the source code
for your app to this repository. Send an email to support@assembly.com if you
have problems accessing your repository.

#### App Distribution

When you are ready to submit your app to the App Store for review, send an
email to support@assembly.com with your product name and a link to your source
code repositories.

#### Monetization and In-App purchases

Send an email to support@assembly.com if you are planning to add in-app
purchases or use ad SDKs to monetize your app.

#### Domains

Assembly holds domains on behalf of the respective products to which they
belong. All products on Assembly must transfer ownership of their domains
within 90 days of joining the platform. Products that have not transfered their
domains within this time frame will be removed from the platform.

If you already own a domain that you would like to use with your Assembly
product, unlock your domain at your registrar and email support@assembly.com
with an authorization code to initialize the transfer.

If you do not have a domain and would like to purchase one, email
support@assembly.com. Include the name of your Assembly product, the desired
domain name, and a link to the Github repository for your product.
