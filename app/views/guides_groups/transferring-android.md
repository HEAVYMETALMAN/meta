# Transferring An Existing Android App
#### App Ownership
To move your product onto Assembly, you will need to transfer ownership so that we can track revenue, expenses, and disburse profits to you and your contributors.

#### Transferring your app with Google Play
To transfer your application to Assembly's Google Play Account, you need to look up the transaction ID for your develop registration. It is available in the [Google Wallet dashboard](https://wallet.google.com/manage/), and should look like this `01234567890123456789.token.0123456789012345` or `0.G.123456789012345`. For a guided walktrough, check out Google's [app transfer checklist](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/checklist/3294213).

If your app has in-app purchases, you have to define a country price in USD for each in-app purchase product before you start the transfer.

Request an app transfer by filling out an [Application Transfer Request](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/appt) with Google.

#### Ad SDK Integrations
If your app uses Ad SDKs such as AdMob, you will need to update SDK integrations. Send an email to support@assembly.com for information on how to do this.

#### App Analytics
If you are tracking analytics with Google Analytics, add user permissions for ben@assembly.com to your Google Analytics account.

#### Source code
Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Your product repo will be located at `github.com/asm-products/PRODUCTSLUG`. Please push the source code for your app to this repository. Send an email to support@assembly.com if you have problems accessing your repository.


#### Domains
Domains for Assembly products are held by core team members in the community(that's you!). When you choose to contribute to a product, it's important to note who holds the domain and to build trust with that person as you build a product together. If you own a domain for a product, you might put a pledge in the product description that shows your commitment to protecting it on behalf of the community.
