# Hosting

#### What hosting provider should I use?

Assembly can often cover paid hosting costs for products that use Heroku.
To get started with this process, email support@assembly.com to transfer
ownership of your Heroku app.  You are free to use other platforms, such as
AWS, DigitalOcean, Google App Engine, or others. However, we do not yet support
paying for these providers.

# Domains

Domains for Assembly products are held by core team members in the community. When you choose to contribute to a product, it's important to note who holds the domain and to build trust with that person as you build a product together. If you own a domain for a product, you might put a pledge in the product description that shows your commitment to protecting it on behalf of the community.

# Version Control

#### Github repositories

Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products
organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Any users on your product's
Core Team will have write access as long as their Github account is linked on
Assembly.

#### Adding or removing contributors

Please email support@assembly.com if you need to grant write access to non-core
users or remove write access.
