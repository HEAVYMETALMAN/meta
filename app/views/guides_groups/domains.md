# Hosting

#### What hosting provider should I use?

You are free to use whatever hosting platform you choose, such as Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, Google App Engine, or others.

# Domains

Domains for Assembly products are held by core team members in the community. When you choose to contribute to a product, it's important to note who holds the domain and to build trust with that person as you build a product together. If you own a domain for a product, you might put a pledge in the product description that shows your commitment to protecting it on behalf of the community.

# Version Control

#### Github repositories

Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products
organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Any users on your product's
Core Team will have write access as long as their Github account is linked on
Assembly.

#### Adding or removing contributors

Please email support@assembly.com if you need to grant write access to non-core
users or remove write access.
