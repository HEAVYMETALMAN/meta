# How can I get to know other Assembly community members?

The best way to do this is to become an active member. Introduce yourself to the team working on a project you like, and see how you can help. Collaboration is what makes Assembly special, and youâ€™ll start to see that as soon as you start working side-by-side with great people.

Pro-tip Assembly supports both [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and Emoji site wide.


# Where should I communicate with people on Assembly?

If you want to talk about a specific bounty, the comments section underneath it is the best place to do this.



# How can I change my avatar?

Assembly uses [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) for avatars. Head over there, create an account with the email address you used to sign up for Assembly, and add an avatar. It should start appearing on Assembly moments later.


# How can I call attention or assign a bounty to someone?

The best way to do this is to @mention the person's username in the comments below a bounty.
