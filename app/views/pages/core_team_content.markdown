## Super Powers

### Push Access to GitHub
Core Team members have direct access to GitHub. They can push directly to the repos and merge other people’s pull requests. Core Team members are trusted to be awesome so their code to be doesn’t need review before pushing and they can accept other code.

Assembly is working on ways to help give the Core Team greater access to 3rd party services like [Heroku](https://heroku.com), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [BugSnag](https://bugsnag.com). Thats coming.

### Awarding WIPs
The Core Team can award WIPs to other contributors. To do this they can click the little “star icon” over their avatar in a WIP.  Try to award the comment where somebody actually points to the work that they have done (that way Assembly can build up more structured data around the work done on Helpful).

Awarding WIPs means the Core Team can give other members of the community ownership of Helpful. What should be awarded is a common & evolving question. There aren’t any hard and fast rules and it’s definitely up to each member’s judgement. However, the we recommend the Core Team consider:

* _Focus_. If the work doesn’t solve the problem that the WIP asked for then that’s a reason to not award. Try to clarify the contributor’s understanding of the task or create a new WIP for the work.
* _Progress_. If a contribution introduces more issues than it solves then it shouldn’t be awarded.
* _Speed_. A WIP doesn’t have to be perfect but if it helps solve an immediate issue it should be merged. For example [#203](https://cove.assembly.com/helpful/wips/203)
* _Quality_. This is entirely subjective but good work should be rewarded. For an example see [@chexee vs. @vlad in #101](https://cove.assembly.com/helpful/wips/101).

The Core Team can also “un-award” a WIP, but this exceptional rather than a habitual.

### Closing WIPs
Discussions that are spam, off-topic, or rambling can be closed. The Core Team has to provide a reason as to why they’re closing it so it’s obvious for the rest of the people in the conversation. It’s an authoritative action, so Assembly enforces this reasoning to help clarify the Core’s intentions. If work is closed with no discussion as to why, people can be left confused and aren’t given an avenue of recourse.

### Promoting WIPs
If something is a top priority but hasn’t received much attention, the Core Team can promote it. This means that every vote on that WIP counts for two votes. This provides an economic incentive for completing that work.

The Core Team should leave a comment as to why they think it should be promoted (as they would when closing a WIP). This is something Assembly will enforce in the future.


## How to be Radical

These aren’t intended as rules, but more as a starting block to start thinking about the Core Teams involvement in the project. Again, none of this is required (or expected), they're just some things we've learnt along the way.

### Communication

Above anything else, good leaders are good communicators. What defines “good” is up for debate, but I’d suggest that clear thoughts, overly-communicated is a start. In a system like Assembly where nobody has any power to tell others what to do, the only way things get done is either do it yourself or convince somebody else that it’s worth doing.

### Discussing WIPs
Assembly is a community process and discussions should be open to the community. While the Core Team has additional power, anybody has the ability to jump in and comment in a discussion. This process helps more ideas be generated, better decisions be made and lets everybody become owners of a product.

### Working
The Core Team work on products like everybody else. While it may feel like they’re managers, people only respect leaders who get their hands dirty. Who did you like more in Braveheart: William Wallace who lead his army from the front line or the British generals who issued orders from the safety of a hill?

### A Good Workflow
Not sure where to start? Assembly recommends Core Team members think about the steps they need to take and get in a rhythm so they spend the least amount of time working on Helpful. A good daily workflow that has worked for [@chrislloyd](https://cove.assembly.com/users/chrislloyd) looks like:

1. Use Helpful
2. Review pull requests on GitHub
3. Check out new discussions
4. Check out WIPs up for review
5. Check out WIPs in progress

Dog-fooding Helpful is the quickest way of knowing what needs to be done. If you’re not currently using a product, we *highly* recommend finding a way to use the product. If you can’t do this (or it’s too impractical) let the other Core Team members know and they can start thinking of a way to incorporate you.


## The Perks

Onto the fun stuff! We’re still working on how to formalize these perks but so tentatively:

* You’ll get a special invites to any Assembly camps/meetups
* You have a *very* loud voice in determining new features for Assembly.
